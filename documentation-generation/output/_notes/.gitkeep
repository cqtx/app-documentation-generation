# Working Notes Directory
#
# AI-generated notes files are saved here during documentation generation.
# These files protect against context limits by capturing analysis incrementally.
#
# Expected structure:
#   _notes/
#   ├── {ProjectName}/
#   │   ├── ARCHITECTURE.notes.md
#   │   ├── API.notes.md
#   │   ├── CONFIGURATION.notes.md
#   │   ├── DATA.notes.md
#   │   └── WORKFLOWS.notes.md
#   └── {RepositoryName}/
#       └── REPOSITORY.notes.md
#
# These are working files and can be deleted after documentation is complete.
# They may be useful for reviewing what the AI analyzed if output seems incomplete.
